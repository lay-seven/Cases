    <div>Hello Atguigu</div>
    <p>
        A young man asked Socrates the secret to success. Socrates told the
        young man to meet him near the river the next morning. They met.
        Socrates asked the young man to walk with him toward the river. When the
        water got up to their neck, Socrates took the young man by surprise and
        ducked him into the water. The boy struggled to get out but Socrates was
        strong and kept him there until the boy started turning blue. Socrates
        pulled his head out of the water and the first thing the young man did
        was to gasp and take a deep breath of air. Socrates asked, “What did
        you want the most when you were there?” The boy replied, “Air.”
        Socrates said, “That is the secret to success. When you want success as
        badly as you wanted the air, then you will get it. There is no other
        secret.”
